Task: Real-time face &amp; emotion detection

Brief overview about each file:

(1) FaceAndEmotion recognises the human face and its emotion in realtime

(2) datasetCreator: code to collect images of a person with a corresponding user id

(3) classifier: code that trains the images taken in datasetCreator and outputs a .yml file (trainer5.yml in this case)

(4) emotiontrain: A CNN to get a trained model for human emotions using fer2013.csv (can be downloaded from the link https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data )
and results in fer9.h5 and fer9.json files.

(5) haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml : front face classifier

trainer5.yml can be accessed by the following link:
